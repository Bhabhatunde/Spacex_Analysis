# Spacex_Analysis
This project involves analyzing SpaceX's rocket launches to predict the likelihood of reusing the first stage of their Falcon 9 rockets, thereby estimating the cost of launches. The focus is on understanding the factors influencing the success of the first stage landing and using this information to train a machine learning model for prediction.
